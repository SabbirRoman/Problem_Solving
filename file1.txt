Hi everyone, I'm Sabbir Hasan Roman!  I just graduated with a stellar GPA of 4.67 in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Rajshahi.

Software development is my passion. I've got a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and databases, and I'm proficient in C++, Python, Django, and Git. My coding skills are sharp, honed by solving over 1,200 problems on online judges and participating in more than 200 programming contests.

Dedication? You bet! My competitive spirit is proven by my 140th place finish at the ICPC Dhaka Regional Preliminary 2023, my impressive 4-star Codechef rating, and a hard-earned 1713 Leetcode contest rating.

But I'm not just about algorithms. I also built SANDESH, a personalized real-time news aggregator platform. It uses user profiling, content categorization, and a rule-based recommendation system to deliver an exceptional user experience.

I'm eager to contribute to projects that make a difference. I want to tackle real-world challenges and keep growing my tech expertise.  Let's build something amazing together!
