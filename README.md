![Messy but Mine](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-Messy%20but%20Mine-blueviolet?style=for-the-badge)

This repository is not a clean, production-ready codebase. Instead, it’s a **memory archive** of my competitive programming journey.  
It contains the solutions I wrote while practicing and participating in contests on platforms like **Codeforces, CodeChef, AtCoder,** and others.

## 🚀 About This Repo
- Most of the code here was written during contests (around **2019**).
- The solutions are **messy, unoptimized, and sometimes even hard to read** – but that’s the reality of contest coding.
- It reflects my **growth as a programmer** – from struggling with simple implementation problems to gradually solving **Dynamic Programming** and **Graph** challenges.
- This repository is not meant to be a learning resource for others.  
  It’s more like a **journal of how I used to think and code back then**.

---

## 📂 What You’ll Find
- Random snippets of solutions for problems from various online judges.
- Contest codes written under strict time limits.
- Different problem-solving patterns that show my transition from beginner-level to more advanced problem types.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
I decided to make this repository public because:
- It’s a reminder of **where I started** and how far I’ve come.
- A way to keep my **competitive programming memories alive**.
- Maybe someday, it will inspire someone to see that **messy beginnings are part of the journey**.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
- Don’t expect clean, reusable, or well-documented code here.
- If you’re trying to **learn algorithms or data structures**, this may not be the best resource.
- This is more about **the journey than the destination**.
